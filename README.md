ðŸš¨ Problem Statement
The music industry (labels, artists, and platforms) lacks a centralized, dynamic tool for quickly assessing song and artist performance metrics. This results in difficulty identifying dominant trends, predicting peak engagement periods, and aligning content strategy (e.g., Singles vs. Albums) with actual consumption patterns, ultimately slowing strategic decision-making.
________________________________________
âœ… Solution & Results
We developed an Interactive Music Consumption & Popularity Dashboard utilizing modern data visualization techniques. This solution provides a comprehensive view of streaming performance, enabling users to:
â€¢	Instantly quantify total catalog size and overall average popularity.
â€¢	Track time-series trends for engagement and consumption (Avg Popularity by Month).
â€¢	Segment performance by content format (Single, Album, Compilation) and explicit status.
â€¢	Identify high-impact songs and artists with deep catalog representation.
